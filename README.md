# Multiple Substrings Search

The program implements a tree that allows you to quickly search for multiple substrings in the given string. The algorithm is an extension of the Boyerâ€“Moore algorithm. The vertices of the corresponding tree are the letters of substrings. While symbol-by-symbol moving through the line, there is descending through the tree. In the absence of possible coincidences, a transition occurs along the special edges to the upper vertices of the tree
