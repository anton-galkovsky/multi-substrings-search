# Multiple Substrings Search

The program implements a tree that allows you to quickly search for multiple substrings in the given string. The algorithm is an extension of the Boyerâ€“Moore algorithm. The vertices of the corresponding tree are the letters of substrings. Symbol-by-symbol moving through the line corresponds to descending inside the tree. In case of absence of possible coincidences, a transition occurs along the special edges to the upper vertices of the tree
